				To our minds the Persian Gulf meant pearl diving, an industry that was rapidly dying out. We put Louis Malle ashore to film one of the last pearling sambuks on a cruise out of Dubeh. <span class="translated" data-translation="Les plongeurs étaient âgés">The divers were elderly</span>, wretched looking men. On the pearl grounds they donned nose clips made of shark’s vertebrae, laced hooks on two fingers of each hand, and took up a collecting basket weighted with stones. One pulled on a suit of black underwear, which the nakouda, or pearling captain, said protected him from shark attack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Malle followed them to the follow, where their naked eyes were nearly blind, but their hands moved rapidly and surely, tossing oysters into the basket. <span class="translated" data-translation="Dans les centaines">In the hundreds</span> of shells they brought up, there was not a single pearl. Working away with regular grounds, Calypso divers found a lonely, lopsided pearl that we kept to make a ring for the fiancée of bosun Raud, who was to be married when we got home.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Persian Gulf was often swept by unannounced shambles, a severe gale that lasted about twelve hours. Saôut anticipated busy days holding anchorages and recovering divers when the shamal pounced. Between blows the sea was usually without swell or breeze; the blue-gray expanse looked like a sheet of lead. In this state, on moonless nights, it was the more phosphorescent water we had ever seen. On such a night, <span class="translated" data-translation="j'étais debout">I was standing</span> in the bow with Dugan and Allen Russell, an Australian geologist with D’Arcy Exploration. The top one-inch layer of water was like a radiant glass panel that came alight at the touch of a switch. Calypso moved in an aureole of glowing plankton. Out in the dark an incandescent sea turtle paddled along. The pressure waves of our propellers churned up a silver maelstrom that rolled several hundred feet in our wake. The bioluminescence, however, was not entirely caused by our intrusion. Considerably <span class="translated" data-translation="dessous du panneau de surface">below the surface panel</span> there were explosions of light that we called “flash bulbs,” thousands of salt, shaped not unlike a flash bulb. Russell said, “You know, sailing on board Calypso is so interesting you lose track of time. One morning you could wake up an old man.” I thought he touched on what we received as compensation for the dire struggles ashore. We were wresting weeks of timelessness from the sea.
			</p>
			<p>
				British Petroleum had assigned us to seven area as large as four French departments, in which we were to make detailed maps of gravity variations <span class="translated" data-translation="sur le fond marin">on the sea floor</span> and take samples of the bottom. We used a marine gravimeter, a large bell-like contraption on a traveling crane that ran on rails on Calypso’s deck. We would roll the gravimeter out over the side and lower it to the floor, where it adjusted itself to the perfect level and transmitted gravity readings to receivers on board. If it struck and anomaly in the earth’s gravity level, there might be an oil dome below. The bottom samples also gave helpful information on oil-bearing pockets. If an anomaly coincided with the presence of certain Eocene fossils, the geologists would <span class="translated" data-translation="marqueront le point">mark the spot</span> as promising for test drilling later. We were pledged to carry out this procedure in at least two hundred stations in the Abu Dhabi marine concession.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dumas and I visited her launch and we were most amiably received. The Shell people said we could calibrate our gravimeter on their buoy, which was placed at a point where absolute gravity had been accurately measured, close to a desert island called Halul where they had a Decca station. Later Calypso called at Halul after dark. We saw a light and went ashore. We stumbled across rugged terrain to a window and looked in. A young man with fair hair reaching his shoulders sat engrossed in a book. Dumas knocked. <span class="translated" data-translation="Le jeune homme ouvrit la porte">The young man opened the door</span> and gasped. He pointed to Didi and said, “You’re Frédéric Dumas!” He showed us his book, opened to the place where we had interrupted him. There was a photo of Didi. The book was The Silent World.
			</p>
			<p>
				“I’m Tony Mould”, he said. “Please come in.” We entered the hermit’s air-conditioned lair. “In summer’, he said, “we get 130 degrees and ninety percent humidity.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Dumas said, “It must get monotonous for you”
			</p>
			<p>
				Mould replied, “Busy time here a few weeks back. The shamal was blowing, and a pilgrim sambuk from Persia beached here in sinking condition — <span class="translated" data-translation="deux cents personnes">two hundred people</span> who hadn’t eaten for five days. I radioed for relief, but no ship would come out in the storm. Had to thin out my stores to feed women and kiddies. The men didn’t like it. They were bloody well shocked to see food passing over the head of the house. Had ‘em here eight days before a ship came.”
			</p>
			<p>
				We took the Decca hermit with us to dinner on Calypso, and Laban gave him a haircut. <span class="translated" data-translation="Les plongeurs rassemblés autour de la chaise de coiffeur">The divers gathered around the barber chair</span> and asked Mould about underwater conditions. “Don’t happen to be one of you diving johnnies,” said he. “But the pearling boats bury their divers on my island. Come by and I’ll show you their graveyard. Twenty-two blokes there. Two of them taken by sharks, I’m told. The rest by sea snakes.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Before we took up Station One of the survey, I went to Bahrain to arrange for supplies and find out about sea snakes. The French consul and <span class="translated" data-translation="plusieurs médecins">several physicians</span> told me that the lethal marine serpent of the Persian Gulf was no myth. There were untold numbers of them in several species growing as long as cobras, and they dealt a venom for which no antidote was available. “However,” said an expert, “even a seven-fitter has such a tiny mouth that it cannot bite the major planes of a human body. It has to strike <span class="translated" data-translation="un petit pli de peau">a small fold of skin</span>, such as the soft tendon between the thumb and forefinger.” I wondered why nature had made a killer with such a poor applicator and returned to Calypso apprehensively pinching a certain tendon.
			</p>
			<p>
				At our first geological station we rigged the drop corer to obtain bottom samples. The corer was a bomb-shaped steel device that weighted a third of a ton. Fitted in its nose was a tempered steel coring pipe. We dropped the bomb in forty-five feet of water. When we hauled it in, the coring pipe was missing. Divers went down and found it lying of a flat sand bottom, bent into an S. The cutting mouth was crumpled like a <span class="translated" data-translation="serviette en papier">paper napkin</span>. The divers scooped into the sand. An inch below was rock like armor plate. In previous tests the coring pipe had bitten several inches into the limestone. What sort of rock was this?
			</p>
			<p>
				We fitted another pipe and bombed the floor again. The pipe came up attached but bent into a Z, and the cutting edge was smashed. Two of our four coring pipes were ruined on the first station. Another team went down with a crowbar, stuck it into a mollusk hole, and pried off a few chips, but there were not enough for the geologists. Dumas went after a bigger sample with a pneumatic chisel. He inserted it in a mussel boring and <span class="translated" data-translation="alluma l'air comprimé">turned on the compressed air</span>. He bounced ten feet off the bottom. Each time he tried to dent the rock, the stabbing chisel sent him flying.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dumas surfaced and added weights to his belt. We also lowered the antishark cage for him to cling onto for leverage. He obtained a few inadequate rock fragments. Short of a prolonged and expensive blasting attack, <span class="translated" data-translation="le plancher blindé">the armored floor</span> seemed to be resting all methods of sampling.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, we tried again, sending down one man with a cold chisel and another with a big maul. One held the chisel and the other pounded it, as if driving a tent stake. It is an extraordinary physical feat to swing a hammer thought a medium at least eight hundred times heavier than air, and without a purchase on the ground. <span class="translated" data-translation="Pourtant, nos hommes l'ont fait">Yet our men did it</span>. They chiseled out acceptable samples on 150 stations. We continued working in the season-in-a-desert thought squalls and sandstorms. While the water was as cold as that of the Mediterranean in winter, we baked on deck. The only diversion on days off was to watch camel races in the primitive village of Abu Dhabi.
			</p>
			<p>
				We used the antishark cage as an elevator to take the divers to and from their labors. <span class="translated" data-translation="Sur le sol">On the floor</span> it also served as an emergency refuge. However, its bars, spaced eight inches apart, would not exclude sea snakes. During the first week’s work we saw no snakes. Then, passing to a new station, we came to a flat sea covered with writing white-and-yellow-barred ribbons. The snakes looked as unreal as the articulated wooden ones that pop out of Hindu trick boxes. Some dived away from Calypso, while others drifted quite close. It would have been easy to scoop some of them up with a spoon net, but nobody darted to do it. To our relief, the next geological station lay beyond a big snake patch.
			</p>
			<p>
				I took a movie camera and joined Dumas and Kientzy in the cage. <span class="translated" data-translation="La visibilité était médiocre">Visibility was poor</span> below — fifteen or twenty feet. When the elevator reached bottom, Dumas fanned away the thin layer of dust on the hard rock looking for a crack into which he could insert a chisel, while Kientzy and I wandered about inspecting the paltry life forms on the floor. Around scrubby little gorgonians there were <span class="translated" data-translation="poissons de récif incolores">colorless reef fishes</span> — nothing worth filming. Then, materializing from the fog, came our first sea snake. It undulated along close to the bottom. Its head was ridiculously small and its mouth was unimpressive. It passed us without curiosity and faded into the turbid sea. A second and bigger one arrived. It was about <span class="translated" data-translation="sept pieds de long">seven feet long</span>. The snake circled around us languidly. The eyes in its incredible pinhead were so small we could not tell whether or not it was interested in us. I maneuvered for a camera position in front of it and motioned for Kientzy to swim into the lens field. He misunderstood and swung his hammer, trying to batter the snake’s head into the floor. It was pretty ludicrous to see a man try and hit an animal almost as fluid as water itself. Yet Kientzy succeed with a terrible blow near the head. The snake swam nervously away despite the mortal would. I asked the divers not to attack the snakes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Several days passed before we saw another sea snake. In fact, <span class="translated" data-translation="c'était une occurrence rare">it was a rare occurrence</span>, and they never molested us in thousands of dives in the Persian Gulf. I think they are just one more creature defamed as a monster.
